# BrewNet: Geo-Location Based Connection Building Platform

## 🚀 Introduction
In an increasingly digital world, meaningful **real-world** connections remain a challenge. **BrewNet** is a **geo-location-powered networking platform** that enables users to connect with like-minded individuals in their vicinity, fostering both social and professional relationships. Unlike traditional networking apps, BrewNet prioritizes **real-time discovery**, **interest-based matchmaking**, and **consent-driven interactions**, ensuring that connections are **relevant, safe, and impactful**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many individuals struggle to find people who share their interests **near them** due to a lack of **real-time discovery tools**. Traditional social networking platforms focus on global connections but are not optimized for **location-based** interactions. BrewNet aims to bridge this gap by providing a **scalable, privacy-focused** solution for discovering and connecting with people **nearby**.

## 🌟 Key Features
✅ **Real-Time Location-Based Discovery**: Suggests users within a specified radius using **Google Maps API & Geospatial Indexing**.  
✅ **Interest-Based Matchmaking**: Uses **ML models** to recommend users based on shared interests and preferences.  
✅ **Consent-Driven Connections**: Users must **mutually accept** requests before interacting, ensuring safety and privacy.  
✅ **Dynamic Visibility & Privacy Controls**: Users can choose their visibility, limit requests, or appear **only in specific categories**.  
✅ **Efficient Geospatial Querying**: Uses **MongoDB Geospatial Indexing** & **PostGIS for high-performance queries**.  
✅ **Real-Time Interactions**: Implemented using **WebSockets** for seamless updates.  
✅ **Mobile-Friendly Architecture**: Optimized for low battery usage and minimal resource consumption.  

## 🔥 Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
Unlike conventional social platforms, **BrewNet is built on hyperlocal, real-time discovery and meaningful interactions**.
